# FeyFriends
The mod shows the number of players from certain groups on the screen, default - in the left top corner. If desired, you can turn on the sound of notifications when the number of players changes, display the full list of players, etc. To customize the display of groups and notifications, use the GUI (default button is "H") ((NOT THE MODMENU BUTTON)). The mod also adds a keybind to display the full list of online players and their number in the chat (default - "J"); keybind for displaying all categories and players in them in the chat (default - "O").

Since version 0.4.0, you can use the `/feyfriends <args>` command instead of the GUI to edit groups.

Mod is still in EARLY BETA, so if there are any bugs or problems, comments and suggestions are welcome :3
